# send-doubles
Send arrays of double via UDP

Very often, I need to send data which are entirely in double, such as from several sensors, to a remote application via a UDP channel. This program are meant to test sending and receiving array of doubles with a simplest format.

The codes are written with Python 2.7.6.
